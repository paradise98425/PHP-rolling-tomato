1. FIX OUT CODE 
        Solution 1: 
            1. needed to have "php" after <? on both the index.php and map-stuff.php file
                /********************************/
                By the way, brief open tags are allowed. (However, it is discouraged because it is by 
                default deactivated and can only be utilized after changing the php.ini configuration file.)
                /*********************************/
            2. had an unnecessary ";" on return statement of  geoJson function.

        Solution 2:
            the way coordinates were supplied were simply inverted as 
                    Leaflet expects [latitude, longitude] order
                    GeoJSON expects [longitude, latitude] order
                Since we are using GeoJSON data format, they should be altered to have  ['.$lon1.', '.$lat1.'],

        Solution 3: 
            body tag with class name by default had margin as 8px, it had be set to 0 margin.
